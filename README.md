MtGox API credentials file: mtgox.properties
------------------------

To keep your API credentials safe, they are stored in a separate file called mtgox.properties.  This filename is hard-coded into the application which will look for this file in the current directory.

    # MtGox API key
    apikey=PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    # MtGox API secret
    apisecret=PUT_YOUR_API_SECRET_HERE

Compiling from source
---------------------

To build on Windows...

1.  Make sure you have a recent Java JDK installed & configured as normal.

2.  Download Maven.  (Check the downloaded file's properties and "unblock" it if you have windows protection turned on)
http://mirror.mel.bkb.net.au/pub/apache/maven/maven-3/3.0.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.zip

3.  Extract the maven zip into anywhere, e.g., c:\tools\maven-3.0.4

4.  Edit your environment PATH to include the maven 'bin' directory.  e.g., c:\tools\maven-3.0.4\bin

5.  Clone the GitHub repo to your local computer and then open the project in GitHub for Windows and in the "Tools" menu, select "Open a shell here"

6.  In the command-line shell that appears, type the following maven command to build the project...

        mvn install
