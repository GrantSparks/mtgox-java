==========

A Java API (based on Spring & Maven) for the MtGox bitcoin exchange WebSocket & HTTP services.

This software is copyright 2012-2013 Grant Sparks, and is distributed under the terms of the Lesser GNU General Public License (LGPL) included in the file LICENSE.TXT.

Warning:  Testing has not yet been done for each currency to ensure that mtgox's various 'magic' mutlipliers work.  Use at own risk and double-check order sizes, prices and volumes are working for your currency before doing any large trades or using in a production environment.

TODO:  The private HTTP API functions and the websocker subscription functions are not yet all there.  Send me a request if you need a particular function that is not yet there.

Release versions are available from Maven Central, add the following dependency to your pom.xml.

        <dependency>

Below is an example of how to use the mtgox java API.

        // Obtain a $USD instance of the API
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("to/sparks/Beans.xml");
        MtGoxAPI mtgoxUSD = (MtGoxAPI) context.getBean("mtgoxUSD");

        // Get the private account info
        Info info = mtgoxUSD.getInfo();
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Logged into account: {0}", info.getLogin());

        // Example of getting the current ticker price
        Ticker ticker = mtgoxUSD.getTicker();
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Last price: {0}", ticker.getLast().getValue());
        
Private API functions need a MtGox.Com API key & secret passed as JVM system properties as shown below.
        
        java -Dapi.key=YOUR_KEY -Dapi.secret=YOUR_SECRET to.sparks.MtGoxExample
