Current status
--------------

Some of the private HTTP API functions and the websocket subscription functions are not yet fully implemented.  Send me a request if you need a particular function that is not available.  You can see what methods are implemented in the java API interface here... http://goo.gl/NxBG6

Using in your own project
-------------------------

Release versions are available from Maven Central, add the following dependency to your pom.xml.

        <dependency>
            <groupId>to.sparks</groupId>
            <artifactId>mtgox</artifactId>
            <version>0.1.5</version>
        </dependency>

You can get developer snapshot releases by adding the following to your maven pom.xml

    <repositories>
        ...
        <repository>
            <id>sonatype-oss-public</id>
            <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>

    <dependencies>
        ...
        <dependency>
            <groupId>to.sparks</groupId>
            <artifactId>mtgox</artifactId>
            <version>0.1.6-SNAPSHOT</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

Below is an example of how to use the mtgox java API.
```java
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("to/sparks/Beans.xml");
        // Obtain a $USD instance of the API
        MtGoxAPI mtgoxUSD = (MtGoxAPI) context.getBean("mtgoxUSD");
        
        // Get handles to the currencies we'll be using
        CurrencyInfo currencyInfo = mtgoxUSD.getCurrencyInfo(mtgoxUSD.getBaseCurrency());
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Base fiat currency: {0}", currencyInfo.getCurrency().getCurrencyCode());

        // Example of getting the current ticker price
        Ticker ticker = mtgoxUSD.getTicker();
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Last price: {0}", ticker.getLast().getPriceValue().getCredits());

        // Get the private account info
        AccountInfo info = mtgoxUSD.getAccountInfo();
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Logged into account: {0}", info.getLogin());
```       

Example mtgox.properties
------------------------

To keep your API credentials safe, they are stored in a separate file called mtgox.properties.  This filename is hard-coded into the application which will look for this file in the current directory.

    # MtGox API key
    apikey=PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
    # MtGox API secret
    apisecret=PUT_YOUR_API_SECRET_HERE

Compiling from source
---------------------

To build on Windows...

1.  Make sure you have a recent Java JDK installed & configured as normal.

2.  Download Maven.  (Check the downloaded file's properties and "unblock" it if you have windows protection turned on)
http://mirror.mel.bkb.net.au/pub/apache/maven/maven-3/3.0.4/binaries/apache-maven-3.0.4-bin.zip

3.  Extract the maven zip into anywhere, e.g., c:\tools\maven-3.0.4

4.  Edit your environment PATH to include the maven 'bin' directory.  e.g., c:\tools\maven-3.0.4\bin

5.  Clone the GitHub repo to your local computer and then open the project in GitHub for Windows and in the "Tools" menu, select "Open a shell here"

6.  In the command-line shell that appears, type the following maven command to build the project...

        mvn install
