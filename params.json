Use at own risk and double-check order sizes, prices and volumes are working for your currency before doing any large trades or using in a production environment.\r\n\r\nTODO:  The private HTTP API functions and the websocker subscription functions are not yet all there.  Send me a request if you need a particular function that is not yet there.\r\n\r\nRelease versions are available from Maven Central, add the following dependency to your pom.xml.\r\n\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>to.sparks</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>mtgox</artifactId>\r\n            <version>0.1.0</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n\r\nYou can get developer snapshot releases by adding the following to your maven pom.xml\r\n\r\n    <repositories>\r\n        ...\r\n        <repository>\r\n            <id>sonatype-oss-public</id>\r\n            <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/</url>\r\n            <releases>\r\n                <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n            </releases>\r\n            <snapshots>\r\n                <enabled>true</enabled>\r\n            </snapshots>\r\n        </repository>\r\n    </repositories>\r\n\r\n    <dependencies>\r\n        ...\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>to.sparks</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>mtgox</artifactId>\r\n            <version>0.1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n    </dependencies>\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of how to use the mtgox java API.\r\n\r\n        // Obtain a $USD instance of the API\r\n        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext(\"to/sparks/Beans.xml\");\r\n        MtGoxAPI mtgoxUSD = (MtGoxAPI) context.getBean(\"mtgoxUSD\");\r\n\r\n        // Get the private account info\r\n        Info info = mtgoxUSD.getInfo();\r\n        logger.log(Level.INFO, \"Logged into account: {0}\", info.getLogin());\r\n\r\n        // Example of getting the current ticker price\r\n        Ticker ticker = mtgoxUSD.getTicker();\r\n        logger.log(Level.INFO, \"Last price: {0}\", ticker.getLast().getValue());\r\n        \r\nPrivate API functions need a MtGox.Com API key & secret passed as JVM system properties as shown below.\r\n        \r\n        java -Dapi.key=YOUR_KEY -Dapi.secret=YOUR_SECRET to.sparks.MtGoxExample\r\n\r\nContact the author grant@sparks.to for reporting bugs or asking questions.
